## üîÑ Core User Flow

### 1. Get Current Location & Destination
- Frontend uses browser/mobile geolocation to get the current `lat/lng`.
- Calls Google Maps / GoMaps Geocoding API to convert the destination address into `destLat/destLng`.

### 2. Search Nearby Students
- **API Request:**
```http
GET /api/v1/rides/search?lat={curLat}&lng={curLng}&destLat={dLat}&destLng={dLng}&radius=5km
